            Hi, my name is Rui Zhang and I have been programming since 2018. So on this website, I would like to share my progress in the future.
            I will also include programs that I've created so people can download them if they want.

                I live in Germany and attend Annette-von-Droste-h√ºlshof Grammar. I have always been very interested in programming, as I used to play a lot of games and thus thought that programming was going to be fun too. Soon, when I got into this school, I realized how coding really was my cup of tea. 
              </p>
              <p data-no-scroll>
                I like to program a lot.
                I first programmed in school, when I joined a programming club. We used Scratch to make some games. When I first took programming classes in school in 8th grade, I began to learn Python and other languages like C, C++, C#, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                In the end though, I stuck to Python because of it's simplicity. Now I am picking up Java to get better at OOB and because my next goal is to make a Game or Mod for Minecraft in Java, something I've been wanting to do for a long time now.
              </p>
              <p data-no-scroll>
                During this time I have done many things. And I want a place where I can share the things I have done and things I will do. So this Website will help me do that.
              </p>
              <p data-no-scroll>
                As of now (13.04.2020) I have made some things such as a Tic Tac Toe AI, a Moodle Calendar and a Turtle Module Tutorial-Game and a Maze Algorithm in python as well as a Website called Einrad Minus 1 which deals with Unicycling, another hobby of mine.
                I have also solved a number of programming problems that I have found on the internet.
              </p>
              <p data-no-scroll>
                All of these projects will be available on the "My Projects" section of this website, some of them aren't there yet, but I will soon be adding them to that section too.
